CoffeeApp
=========
- The coffee app displays a list of coffee items downloaded from the coffee API.
- This project uses core data in order to work in offline mode. When the home button is hit the app saves whats been downloaded so far.
- A fetched results controller will notify the tableview when updates occur. This comes in handy when asychronous downloads for the coffee images return and update the model.
- The pictures have been scaled to fit and then trimmed to that they all align correctly. Also all done with autolayout.
- The tableview cells use autolayout and have dynamic heights.
